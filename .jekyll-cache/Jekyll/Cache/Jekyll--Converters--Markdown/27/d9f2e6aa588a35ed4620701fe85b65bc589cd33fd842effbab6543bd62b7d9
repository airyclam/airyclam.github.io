I"<p>Javascript and Athletic Software Engineering.</p>

<p>       Before taking software engineering at UH Manoa, I had never worked with javascript. I knew it was used to implement interactivity on web pages, but that was as much as I knew about the language. After doing a few homework and classwork exercises in javascript, I have realized how versatile the language is. I no longer have to worry about data types and function outputs being consistent. Also, with so many useful functions in the standard library, I can complete a wide range of tasks with just a few lines of code.</p>

<p>       These characteristics of javascript make the langauge especially suitable for Dr. Philip Johnson’s “<a href="https://philipmjohnson.org/essays/athletic-software-engineering.html">athletic software engineering</a>” teaching model, a model focused on teaching students to code quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>       “Athletic software engineering” takes a page from sport pedagogy. In order to get good at a sport, you need to practice. Drilling yourself over and over again. Taking language for another example. If you’re fluent you should be able to write an essay particularly quickly without really focusing on grammar but more the ideas behind the sentences.</p>
