I"K	<p>Javascript and Athletic Software Engineering.</p>

<p>       Before taking software engineering at UH Manoa, I had never worked with javascript. I knew it was used to implement interactivity on web pages, but that was as much as I knew about the language. After doing a few homework and classwork exercises in javascript, I have realized how versatile it is. I no longer have to worry about data types and function outputs being consistent. Also, with so many useful functions in the standard library, I can complete a wide range of tasks with just a few lines of code.</p>

<p>       The efficiency of javascript code makes the language especially suitable for Dr. Philip Johnson’s <a href="https://philipmjohnson.org/essays/athletic-software-engineering.html">athletic software engineering</a> teaching model, a model focused on teaching students to code quickly.</p>

<blockquote> <em>  [Athletic Software Engineering] is a pedagogy in which some or all of the
             course is organized into a series of skills to be acquired. For
             each skill, students are given “workouts” (practice problems)
             along with videos showing the instructor performing each
             workout correctly, quickly, with verbal explanations of their
             choice of tools and design techniques as they apply them.
             Students are advised to repeat the workout until they can
             complete it not just correctly, but in approximately the same
             time as the instructor. </em> </blockquote>

<p>       “Athletic software engineering” takes a page from sport pedagogy. In order to get good, you need to practice. Back in high school when I was training for varsity tennis tryouts, I would spend hours a day doing drills with my coach multiple times a week. We would practice all the different strokes in multiple different scenarios to ensure that I was ready for game day. Even after I got onto the varsity team, it just meant even more practicing. Nothing beats repetition when learning a new skill, and coding is no different. Sure the opponent / project may be different each time, but you’ll always be relying on your fundamentals to win.</p>

<p>       As for how</p>
