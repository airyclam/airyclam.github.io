<p>This is an implementation of a flight reservation system I made for ICS 211. The user navigates through a text-based menu to perform a variety of tasks such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new passenger</li>
  <li>Edit information for an existing passenger</li>
  <li>Display all passenger information based on name</li>
  <li>Display all passenger information based on number of segments flown</li>
  <li>Book a reservation
    <ul>
      <li>If thereâ€™s no seats available on the flight, add the passenger to the waitlist</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cancel a reservation
    <ul>
      <li>If thereâ€™s a waitlist, add passengers in order of the waitlist</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Display all flights with flight details</li>
</ul>

<p>In this project I gained experience working with various kinds of data structures and implementing them in a practical setting. The most challenging part for me was figuring out how to structure the waitlist. I envisioned one linked list with all the names reserving a flight so that removing one name would move the others up, but I wasnâ€™t sure exactly how to separate the top 5 as the passengers and the rest as the waitlist. I ended up making a for loop in the main class as shown below.</p>
<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Prints out Passenger List and Waitlist</span>

    <span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Having this loop in the main class ensures that the passenger and waitlist are up-to-date when called. One disadvantage of this setup is that if I wanted to call all the names in the waitlist, I would need to make an extra 5 iterations before getting access to the first name of the waitlist. An extra 5 iterations doesnâ€™t make very much of a difference, however. Also, since I only ever call the waitlist with the passenger list, itâ€™s not a waste.</p>

<p>If I did need them to be called separately, an arraylist would allow me to do this. However, since a waitlist is a set of data thatâ€™s constantly having names tacked on at the end and names removed from various positions, a linked list is best suited for this problem.</p>
