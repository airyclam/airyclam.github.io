<p>This is an implementation of a flight reservation system I made for ICS 211. The user navigates through a text-based menu that allows the user to perform a variety of tasks.</p>

<p>In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including <a href="http://mongodb.com">MongoDB</a> for database storage, the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.</p>
