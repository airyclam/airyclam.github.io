<p>This is an implementation of a flight reservation system I made for ICS 211. The user navigates through a text-based menu to perform a variety of tasks such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new passenger</li>
  <li>Edit information for an existing passenger</li>
  <li>Display all passenger information based on name</li>
  <li>Display all passenger information based on number of segments flown</li>
  <li>Book a reservation
    <ul>
      <li>If there’s no seats available on the flight, add the passenger to the waitlist</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cancel a reservation
    <ul>
      <li>If there’s a waitlist, add passengers in order of the waitlist</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Display all flights with flight details</li>
</ul>

<p>In this project I gained experience working with various kinds of data structures and implementing them in a practical setting.</p>
