I"ö<p>Javascript and Athletic Software Engineering.</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  Before taking software engineering at UH Manoa, I had never worked with javascript. I knew it was used to implement interactivity on web pages, but that was as much as I knew about the language. After doing a few homework and classwork exercises in javascript, I have realized how versatile the language is. I no longer have to worry about data types and function outputs being consistent. Also, with so many useful functions in the standard library, I can complete a wide range of tasks with just a few lines of code.</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  These characteristics of javascript make the langauge especially suitable for Dr. Philip Johnsonâ€™s â€œathletic software engineeringâ€ teaching model. This model focuses on teaching students to code quickly and efficiently in order to produce functional programs. Being lightly typed means someone very fluent in javascript can output a functional web application from scratch within a few hours.</p>
