<p>This is an implementation of a flight reservation system I made for ICS 211. The user navigates through a text-based menu to perform a variety of tasks such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new passenger</li>
  <li>Edit information for an existing passenger</li>
  <li>Display all passenger information based on name</li>
  <li>Display all passenger information based on number of segments flown</li>
  <li>Book a reservation
    <ul>
      <li>If thereâ€™s no seats available on the flight, add the passenger to the waitlist</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cancel a reservation
    <ul>
      <li>If thereâ€™s a waitlist, add passengers in order of the waitlist</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Display all flights with flight details</li>
</ul>

<p>In this project I gained experience working with various kinds of data structures and implementing them in a practical setting. The most challenging part for me was figuring out how to structure the waitlist. I envisioned one big priority queue with all the names reserving a flight so that removing one name would move the others up, but I wasnâ€™t sure exactly how to separate the top 5 as the passengers and the rest as the waitlist.
