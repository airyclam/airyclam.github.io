<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  This past summer, I started working at Pacific Health Analytics Collaborative, a research group that uses applied analytics to drive public health policy in Hawaii. Under this group, Iâ€™m currently assigned to a project to automate the creation of the yearly <a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/substance-abuse/files/2019/06/Alcohol_2018_Hawaii_State_Epidemiologic_Profile.pdf">epidemiological profiles</a> on drug and alcohol abuse. The person previously working on this project got moved to a different task, thus it was passed onto me and my coworker Kyle.</p>
