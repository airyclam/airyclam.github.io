I"²<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  In primary school weâ€™re always taught the mantra â€œThere are no dumb questions.â€ No one should feel ashamed for asking a question that other people know the answer to - thatâ€™s the very nature of a question. You ask a question to get answers on a topic youâ€™re not as familiar with as someone else. However, there is a caveat to this statement. Although there are no dumb questions, there are definitely dumb ways to ask a question. Especially in computer science, youâ€™re definitely going to run into problems you donâ€™t know how to solve. In these cases, it is important to make sure to ask questions the â€œrightâ€ way for two reasons.</p>
<ol>
  <li>People can clearly understand what your problem is.</li>
  <li>People will want to help you.</li>
</ol>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  To describe what I mean, Iâ€™ll show some examples of â€œsmartly wordedâ€ and â€œnot smartly wordedâ€ questions found on StackOverflow.</p>

<h3 id="dumb-question-1">Dumb Question #1</h3>
<h4 id="noe-aysnc-doc-says-it-is-faster-than-async-and-why-can-it-be-faster">noe-aysnc doc says it is faster than async, and why can it be faster?</h4>
<blockquote> referring to the doc, neo-async's benchmark shows it is faster than async. 
             so, plz someone tell me why?
             maybe I should dig into the code when I have time, but for now, if someone knows, plz.  </blockquote>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  It seems almost surreal that someone would post this and think they would get an answer. First off, what are they even talking about? Iâ€™m assuming they read the documentation of some sort of library and they want to know more about how that library does a certain task faster than anotherâ€¦ but thatâ€™s all I can decipher from this. It would be a lot more helpful if this person included a link to the documentation theyâ€™re looking at. If this library is not very popular, maybe even emailing the author directly might be better. The biggest problem here, though, is that <strong>the writer of this question does not seem to care</strong>. It reads like theyâ€™re texting a friend, even saying â€œmaybe I should dig into the code <strong>when I have time</strong>â€. If youâ€™re not going to put in time to look for the answer to your question, or even the time to format your question coherently, donâ€™t expect other people to spend the time to answer.</p>
