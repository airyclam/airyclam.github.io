<p>       Coming from a biochemistry background, I entered the software engineering world in a sort-of atypical kind of way. I started my college career studying the inner workings of cells. I learned the chemical and molecular processes that drive our existence. But while listening to these lectures on cellular metabolism, I was always amazed at how scientists were able to examine these nanoscopic structures with such rigor. I think this is where my interest in software engineering began.</p>

<p>       This past summer I participated in a series of bioinformatics workshops designed to teach students how to perform bioinformatics searches, analysis, and alignment in R using the Bioconductor package. This was my first real dive into</p>
