I"<h2 id="asking-questions">Asking questions</h2>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  In primary school weâ€™re always taught the mantra â€œThere are no dumb questions.â€ No one should feel ashamed for asking a question that other people know the answer to - thatâ€™s the very nature of a question. You ask a question to get answers on a topic youâ€™re not as familiar with as someone else. However, there is a caveat to this statement. Although there are no dumb questions, there are definitely dumb ways to ask a question. Especially in computer science, youâ€™re definitely going to run into problems you donâ€™t know how to solve. In these cases, it is important to make sure to ask questions the â€œrightâ€ way for two reasons.</p>
<ol>
  <li>People can clearly understand what your problem is.</li>
  <li>People will want to help you.</li>
</ol>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  To describe what I mean, Iâ€™ll show some examples of â€œsmartly wordedâ€ and â€œnot smartly wordedâ€ questions found on StackOverflow.</p>

<h3 id="dumb-question-1">Dumb Question #1</h3>
<h4 id="noe-aysnc-doc-says-it-is-faster-than-async-and-why-can-it-be-faster">noe-aysnc doc says it is faster than async, and why can it be faster?</h4>
<blockquote> referring to the doc, neo-async's benchmark shows it is faster than async. 
             so, plz someone tell me why?
             maybe I should dig into the code when I have time, but for now, if someone knows, plz.  </blockquote>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  It seems almost surreal that someone would post this and think they would get an answer. First off, what are they even talking about? Iâ€™m assuming they read the documentation of some sort of library and they want to know more about how that library does a certain task faster than anotherâ€¦ but thatâ€™s all I can decipher from this. It would be a lot more helpful if this person included a link to the documentation theyâ€™re looking at. If this library is not very popular, maybe even emailing the author directly might be better. The biggest problem here, though, is that the writer of this question seems to not care enough. It reads like youâ€™re texting a friend, even saying â€œmaybe â€œ</p>

<h2 id="first-impressions">First Impressions</h2>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  Today, I experienced my first in-class â€œWorkout of the Dayâ€. We were assigned into pairs to create a javascript function that would take a blackjack hand and calculate the point value. This function would return the point value if less than 21, return â€œBlackjack!â€ if exactly 21, or return â€œBust!â€ if greater than 21. We had 15 minutes to implement this function, but it honestly felt more like 5 minutes. Although the assignment was pretty straightforward, I got caught into snags really quickly.</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  This is what I wrote on my first attempt. After testing with print statements I realized that line 5 wasnâ€™t going to work because the numbers were being read in as a string. To solve this, I had to either make cases for each number or make some sort of dictionary. I was running out of time and I didnâ€™t feel comfortable enough with javascript yet to know how to make a dictionary (which I found out later is just an object with only key value pairs). My partner, Justin, was working on a solution with switch cases which seemed to be working, so we ended up hacking a gross 13 case switch statement in the last minute.</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  Being on a timer is definitely stressful, but also really exciting. Coding assignments in my other computer science classes were always on weekly cycles, where I would meticulously make sure my code was up to the teacherâ€™s standards in terms of style and functionality. Going from weeklong due dates to 15 minute due dates means I can only implement what I immediately know off the top of my head. This is great feedback because it also tells me what Iâ€™m lacking in terms of coding â€œtoolsâ€. With WODS I can objectively examine my skillset and determine what areas I need to develop. Iâ€™m excited to see where I can take my â€œgameâ€ with athletic software engineering.</p>
