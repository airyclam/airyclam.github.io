<p>       At home, my family speaks a few different languages. My parents were born in Vietnam but my grandparents are from China so we speak English, Vietnamese, and Chinese. Although I can understand Vietnamese and Chinese almost fluently, I have a really hard time speaking. I can fully imagine what I want to say, but I’ll get stuck on something simple like the syntax. This is exactly what coding feels like. I’ll have these grand ideas of what I want my user interface to look like. I want a fixed borderless menu at the top, with the company logo on the left and the social media icons on the right. Maybe a grid in the middle with some images and links, and a footer where users can input their email address. However, implementing this into code just seemed way too difficult with raw HTML and CSS.</p>

Or maybe there’s a magical tool that you can speak into and it outputs whatever language you want? Although things like that don’t exist in real life, Semantic UI is pretty darn magical. Semantic UI advertises itself as “a development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML”, and it sure is human friendly. It’s as if my
I can create a fixed borderless menu by literally typing &lt;div class=”ui fixed borderless menu”&gt;&lt;</p>
