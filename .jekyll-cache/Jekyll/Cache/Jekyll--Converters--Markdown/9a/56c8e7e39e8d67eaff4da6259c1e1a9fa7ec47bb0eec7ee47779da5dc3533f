I"p<p>Javascript and Athletic Software Engineering.</p>

<p>       Before taking software engineering at UH Manoa, I had never worked with javascript. I knew it was used to implement interactivity on web pages, but that was as much as I knew about the language. After doing a few homework and classwork exercises in javascript, I have realized how versatile the language is. I no longer have to worry about data types and function outputs being consistent. Also, with so many useful functions in the standard library, I can complete a wide range of tasks with just a few lines of code.</p>
