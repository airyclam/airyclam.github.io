Â Â Â Â Â Â  Coming from a biochemistry background, I entered the software engineering world in a sort-of atypical kind of way. I started my college career studying the inner workings of cells. I learned the chemical and molecular processes that drive our existence. But while listening to these lectures on cellular metabolism, I was always amazed at how scientists were able to examine these nanoscopic structures with such rigor. I think this is where my interest in software engineering began.</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  This past summer I participated in a series of bioinformatics workshops designed to teach students how to perform bioinformatics searches,

analysis, and alignment in R using the Bioconductor package. This experience made me realize how important software development is in research. With Bioconductor, I can retrieve data on whatever protein structures, DNA/RNA strands, and genes I want. I can perform gene expression studies through RNA sequencing. The amount of utility that software provides for researchers is endless.</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â  My goal for this software engineering class is to get comfortable enough with the tools in software development to understand and contribute to open source research software.</p>
