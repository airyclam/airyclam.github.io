<p>       This past summer, I started working at Pacific Health Analytics Collaborative (PHAC), a research group that uses applied analytics to drive public health policy in Hawaii. Under this group, I’m currently assigned to a project to automate the creation of the yearly <a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/substance-abuse/files/2019/06/Alcohol_2018_Hawaii_State_Epidemiologic_Profile.pdf">epidemiological profiles</a> on drug and alcohol abuse. To create these profiles, data from various national surveys are compiled.</p>

<p>       Someone on the team had previously fiddled with some of the survey data and graciously let me and my partner see some of the scripts he wrote as a reference. Right when I opened the scripts, I was surprised at how professional everything looked. There were headers for every function with @param and @return descriptions, and everything was neatly indented. Even though the original author was doing this alone as a side project, it was written so that pretty much anyone with light coding experience could understand.</p>

<p>       Working at PHAC is my first real experience working on a large coding project with peers. With so many different minds working together, it’s important to write clean, easy to understand code. My experiences with ESLint in javascript have been really helpful in developing good habits while writing my code. I hope that by the end of this semester, I’ll have learned from the different style errors I keep seeing pop up in my IDE, and be able to write clean code naturally.</p>
