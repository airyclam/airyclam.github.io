I"<h2 id="asking-questions">Asking questions</h2>

<p>       In primary school we’re always taught the mantra “There are no dumb questions.” No one should feel ashamed for asking a question that other people know the answer to - that’s the very nature of a question. You ask a question to get answers on a topic you’re not as familiar with as someone else. However, there is a caveat to this statement. Although there are no dumb questions, there are definitely dumb ways to ask a question. Especially in computer science, you’re definitely going to run into problems you don’t know how to solve. In these cases, it is important to make sure to ask questions the “right” way for two reasons.</p>
<ol>
  <li>People can clearly understand what your problem is.</li>
  <li>People will want to help you.</li>
</ol>

<p>       To describe what I mean, I’ll show some examples of “smartly worded” and “not smartly worded” questions found on StackOverflow.</p>

<blockquote> referring to the doc, neo-async's benchmark shows it is faster than async. 
             so, plz someone tell me why?
             maybe I should dig into the code when I have time, but for now, if someone knows, plz.  </blockquote>

<p>       “Athletic software engineering” takes a page from sport pedagogy. In order to get good, you need to practice. Back in high school when I was training for varsity tennis tryouts, I would spend hours a day doing drills with my coach multiple times a week. We would practice all the different strokes in multiple different scenarios to ensure that I was ready for game day. Even after I got onto the varsity team, it just meant even more practicing. Nothing beats repetition when learning a new skill, and coding is no different. Sure the opponent / project may be different each time, but you’ll always be relying on your fundamentals to win.</p>

<p>       Today, I experienced my first in-class “Workout of the Day”. We were assigned into pairs to create a javascript function that would take a blackjack hand and calculate the point value. This function would return the point value if less than 21, return “Blackjack!” if exactly 21, or return “Bust!” if greater than 21. We had 15 minutes to implement this function, but it honestly felt more like 5 minutes. Although the assignment was pretty straightforward, I got caught into snags really quickly.</p>

<p>       This is what I wrote on my first attempt. After testing with print statements I realized that line 5 wasn’t going to work because the numbers were being read in as a string. To solve this, I had to either make cases for each number or make some sort of dictionary. I was running out of time and I didn’t feel comfortable enough with javascript yet to know how to make a dictionary (which I found out later is just an object with only key value pairs). My partner, Justin, was working on a solution with switch cases which seemed to be working, so we ended up hacking a gross 13 case switch statement in the last minute.</p>

<p>       Being on a timer is definitely stressful, but also really exciting. Coding assignments in my other computer science classes were always on weekly cycles, where I would meticulously make sure my code was up to the teacher’s standards in terms of style and functionality. Going from weeklong due dates to 15 minute due dates means I can only implement what I immediately know off the top of my head. This is great feedback because it also tells me what I’m lacking in terms of coding “tools”. With WODS I can objectively examine my skillset and determine what areas I need to develop. I’m excited to see where I can take my “game” with athletic software engineering.</p>
