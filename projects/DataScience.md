summary: An initial exploratory analysis I conducted on inflammatory cytokine markers related to aging. 
---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous studies have shown that increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers accelerates the process of biological aging in those above the age of 50. The Allsopp lab is currently exploring the relationship between these markers and FOXO3A, a gene closely related to longevity. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last summer I worked with a team to conduct an initial exploratory analysis on cytokine level data that we collected. The sample size was over 200 patients with 13 different variables collected. My supervisor wanted to know if we could find any correlations using machine learning.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this project initially began without much of a direction from my supervisors, it was one of the events that sparked my interest in data science. This project brought me to participate in a data analysis hackathon a few months later, during which I explored ALS clinical data.
